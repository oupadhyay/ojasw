Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using over 950+ manually labeled video frames with a pipeline for pre‑processing and filtering. Improved from a CNN to a segmented model (YOLOv5), increasing accuracy to 96%. Designed and implemented a Tensorflow Lite Android app, providing real‑time alerts of unsafe bandsaw usage.
