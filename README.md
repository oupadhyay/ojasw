## 🚀 Getting Started

[<img src="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/deploynow.svg" alt="Deploy to Gatsby Cloud">](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/deploynow?url=https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog)

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project

```sh
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

```sh
cd project-name
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

### Code Highlighting

Since the underlying theme ships with [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) and [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) certain additional features were added to code blocks. You can find an overview / usage example in the [example repository](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/examples/minimal-blog/content/posts/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them/index.mdx)! If you want to change certain code styles or add additional language tabs, you need to shadow the file `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/styles/code.js`.

**Language tabs:**

When you add a language (such as e.g. `js` or `javascript`) to the code block, a little tab will appear at the top left corner.

````
```js
// code goes here
```
````

**Code titles:**

You can display a title (e.g. the file path) above the code block.

````
```jsx:title=your-title
// code goes here
```
````

Or without a specific language:

````
```:title=your-title
// code goes here
```
````

**Line highlighting:**

You can highlight single or multiple (or both) lines in a code block. You need to add a language.

````
```js {2,4-5}
const test = 3
const foo = 'bar'
const harry = 'potter'
const hermione = 'granger'
const ron = 'weasley'
```
````

**Hide line numbers:**

If you want to hide line numbers you can either globally disable them (see Theme options) or on a block-by-block basis. You can also combine that with the other attributes.

````
```noLineNumbers
// code goes here
```
````

**react-live:**

Add `react-live` to the code block (and render the component) to see a preview below it.

````
```js react-live
const onClick = () => {
  alert("You opened me");
};
render(<button onClick={onClick}>Alohomora!</button>);
```
````

### Adding content

#### Adding a new blog post

New blog posts will be shown on the index page (the three most recent ones) of this theme and on the blog overview page. They can be added by creating MDX files inside `content/posts`. General setup:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/posts`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Add images to the created folder (from step 1) you want to reference in your blog post
1. Reference an image as your `banner` in the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: Introduction to "Defence against the Dark Arts"
date: 2019-11-07
description: Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) is a subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
tags:
  - Tutorial
  - Dark Arts
banner: ./defence-against-the-dark-arts.jpg
---
```

**The fields `description` and `banner` are optional!** If no description is provided, an excerpt of the blog post will be used. If no banner is provided, the default `siteImage` (from `siteMetadata`) is used.

The `date` field has to be written in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`!

#### Adding a new page

Additional pages can be created by placing MDX files inside `contents/pages`, e.g. an "About" or "Contact" page. You'll manually need to link to those pages, for example by adding them to the navigation (in `navigation` option of the theme). General instructions:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/pages`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter
1. Optionally add files/images to the folder you want to reference from the page

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: About
slug: "/about"
---
```

#### Changing the "Hero" text

To edit the hero text ("Hi, I'm Lupin...), create a file at `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/texts/hero.mdx` to edit the text.

#### Changing the "Projects" part

To edit the projects part below "Latest posts", create a file at `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/texts/bottom.mdx` to edit the contents.

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!
